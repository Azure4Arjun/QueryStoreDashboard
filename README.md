The Query Store Dashboards provides additional query performance information on databases that have the Query Store feature enabled and can be loaded by adding the **.rdl** file as a custom report in SQL Server Management Studio.

You can download the **.rdl** files by selecting the **.zip** file and select the option "Download".
Alternatively you can select the “Release” button and download the “QueryStoreDashboards” .zip file that contains all the Query Store Dashboards.

Installation and usage information can be found on the Wiki.

The dashboard requires Microsoft SQL Server 2016 and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 2016 to work.

The Query Store Dashboards are developed and maintained by Enrico van de Laar (@evdlaar).
