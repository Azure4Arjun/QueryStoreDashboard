This is the repository for the Query Store Dashboard.

The Query Store Dashboard provides additional query performance information on databases that have the Query Store feature enabled and can be loaded by adding the .rdl file as a custom report in SQL Server Management Studio.

The dashboard requires Microsoft SQL Server 2016 and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 2016 to work.
